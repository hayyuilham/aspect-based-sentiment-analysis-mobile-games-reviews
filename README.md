# Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis: Data Mining, Data Science, and Machine Learning

This project builds a model to perform sentiment analysis on the quality of a mobile game based on various aspects of game quality. The data utilized consists of user comments scraped from online platforms, totalling over 180,000 user data entries. The model is constructed using a sequential procedural approach to attain an optimal machine learning model, starting from extracting game quality aspects, preprocessing, sentiment segmentation, feature extraction, oversampling, and machine learning classification.

-----------------------------------------
### Work Done

* Designed and optimized sentiment analysis methods using machine learning with sentiment segmentation and oversampling imbalance. Led to a 8.9% increase accuracy from the base methods.
* Built a flow model that can be utilized for further aspect analysis without providing labelled data as training data, utilizing the SpaCy and VADER method
* Successfully helped the developer easily analysed sentiment complex data reviews for specific sentiment to each aspect quality of the games.
